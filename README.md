# MOTHNODE_ Closer Than Distant

Maynooth - free beat from clover
Slow, pleasant, dark.

```
why obscure the revenant truth
no aim, no goals, no thought, just youth

feeling allright now x2
what do you expect
time for a new day now
kinda round, newer version
fully neutral intentions
cycled the agents
got rid of agencies - (fake)
looked for a decade and nailed it

nice feeling arrived, can't get away now
was hiding my anger and lies
without compromise, i said nice - 
believed my own disguise

feeling allright now x2
what do you expect
time for a new day now
kinda round, newer version
fully neutral intentions
cycled the agents
got rid of agencies - (fake)
looked for a decade and nailed it

clouded smy skies intentionally
had to die to feel my "I" normally
forsake my previous "I"
what you think about me is not in my mind

cycle of vengeance, getting replaced like a follower
putting a lot in a i might just get there (?)

feeling allright now x2
what do you expect
time for a new day now
kinda round, newer version
fully neutral intentions
cycled the agents
got rid of agencies - (fake)
looked for a decade and nailed it

## Music Video

Forest, fog. Standing in a long coat with sunglasses and hat, camera closes in on the back of a person, we see in-ear headset. Reflections in the sunglasses of various electronics displaying patterns.
