# HC_S37_Closer_Than_Distant

Maynooth - free beat
Slow, pleasant, dark.

---

feeling allright now x2
what do you expect
time for a new day now
kinda round, newer version
fully neutral intentions
cycled the agents
got rid of agencies - (fake)
looked for a decade and nailed it

nice feeling arrived, can't get away now
was hiding my anger and lies
without compromise, i said nice - 
believed my own disguise

clouded smy skies intentionally
had to die to feel my "I" normally
forsake my previous "I"
what you think about me is not in my mind

why obscure the revenant truth
no aim, no goals, no thought, just youth

cycle of vengeance
